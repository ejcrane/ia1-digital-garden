            <h2>about</h2>
            <p>
                i have social anxiety. i love music. the solution?
                sharing some of my favorites with you!
            </p>
            <p>
                this is effectively just a fancy list of songs that
                i like, organized by album. you can click on an album
                to view the songs i've given individual ratings to,
                and some of them even have words attached to them!
            </p>
            <p>
                by the way, this isn't wholly asymmetrical. each song
                will eventually have its own comment section that you can lend your
                thoughts to, either critical or just fun. hope you
                enjoy it!
            </p>
